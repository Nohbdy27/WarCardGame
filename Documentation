The program’s goal was to make the card game War in Java. The program can make a shuffled 52-card deck, deal the cards to the user and the dealer, and compare the card values for the first card in each hand. When it compares the values, it either gives the cards to the player or the dealer depending on who’s card has a higher value. When the values are equal, the program checks the third card value and gives the six cards to whoever has a higher value. However, I did have some problems with my program. My target audience is anyone willing to learn to play the war card game. This will teach them how the game functions before playing with other people. Or they can run the program just to play alone. The strength of my program is how the cards are made and shuffled. I can shuffle the deck while keeping the card’s value the same. One of my program’s weaknesses affects my program’s functionality. Most of the time, there are more than 100 rounds of war. So I made the program auto-battle so the user doesn’t have to input something every round. However, this would make my program boring since the game ends right after it starts. Another weakness is the program sometimes never ends or reaches the end in too many loops. To combat this I made a checker to stop the program after too many loops. This also happens when some war battles happen, so I make a checker to stop the program after too many wars. For future improvements, I will want to make a better loop so that I wouldn’t need the checker to stop the program. Also, I would like to make a 312-card deck version so that multiple people can play.
